Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve started the role of Data Analyst but in some future, may be interested in new role in Data Science.

15+ years of experience in Data Analysis, Business Intelligence, Business Analysis, Sales Operations, Project Management, Demand Forecasting, Sales etc. at FMCG (Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark), Media (Group4M). I graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University with Ph.D. in Applied Math.

My technical stack includes:
1.	Data Analysis: Python (+libraries), PySpark, SQL (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse etc.), advanced Excel.
2.	Data Visualization and analysis (BI): Tableau/PowerBI/Redash/Datalens.
3.	Statistical analysis including hypothesis validation.
4.	Data Engineering: Design of DWH/OLAP, ETL/ELT pipelines via Apache Airflow, familiar with Hadoop / Hive.
5.	Classic Machine Learning methods: regression, classification, clustering.
6.	Neural Network Basics: TensorFlow / Keras.
7.	Software version control: Git + Linux.
8.	Product Analytics: Key metrics and analysisâ€™ methods (Cohort, RFM, LTV and others).
9.	Financial Analysis: Analysis of financial statements, Unit-economy, financial modeling etc.
  
Currently, I've been studying new areas in Machine and Deep Learning (Time Series, Recommendatory systems etc.) and Data Engineering (MPP, Greenplum, Hadoop, Spark etc.) to grow further my skills in Data Science.

More information about my work experience can be found  in my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aXeiVeW0HkGBIXJGcGemxd5B2ceEsBf/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=115701271018201293889&rtpof=true&sd=true) or in my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-grebeniuk-5993b88/).

A year ago I started to upload some projects and tasks completed by me at different courses into the Github to share the level of my skills in analytical tools and business areas. I can't place examples of projects and tasks completed in the companies I worked for due to confidentiality agreements signed by me. Also, I started to add some ad-hoc tasks and projects completed by me.
